This workshop will be the 12th in the series of ABINIT developer Workshops,
focusing on recent developments in the ABINIT code.
As in earlier editions, it will feature technical sessions,
discussions (with introductory talks by moderators), round tables and hackathons,
and include invited speakers from outside the ABINIT community to establish links,
open perspectives, and discuss forefront technical/scientific issues.
