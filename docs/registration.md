# Registration

In order to register, please first fill the [Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeVwoxEjRbPuM9BG-Mgftp4UbTc3VqDbJX-6KgQNQujWj5tlQ/viewform?usp=header), before March 10, 2026.
This registration is needed, for both invited speakers and normal participants.

While we would be glad to accept all interested people, there are guaranteed hotel rooms only for 50 people. 
In case we have more than 50 tentative participants and the hotel cannot host all, we will make a selection, based on considerations of proven contributions to ABINIT development and first-come first-serve applications.

# Payment

For invited speakers, no payment is needed (so, no registration fee).

For the other participants, wait for the green light from the organizers. This green light (by mail) is expected no later than March 13, 2026.
Then, the registration will be effective when you will have paid the registration fee by bank transfer, or if a global payment from your institution has been secured by direct contact with the organisers,
<a href="mailto:abidev2026@abinit.org">abidev2026@abinit.org</a>.

For the bank transfer :

 * IBAN : BE52 3701 2883 7309
 * BIC  : BBRUBEBB
 * To : UNIVERSITE CATHOLIQUE DE LOUVAIN, PLACE DE L'UNIVERSITE 1, 1348 LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE
 * Communication : ABIDEV2026 Fee + mention the name of the attendant

The deadline for receiving the registration fee is March 24, 2026 (the hotel must know the number of booked rooms by March 31, 2026).

The registration fee covers the participation to the event from Monday 8 June to Thursday 11 June for one person, including  

  * Three nights either in a single room, or in a shared double room (with another participant).
  * Full board from the Monday 8 June lunch (incl.) to the Thursday 11 June lunch (incl.), also including the coffee breaks.
  * Fixed conference costs, like the rental of the conference room.

The tentative registration fee for a shared double room will be maximum €500 per person, while the tentative registration fee for a single room will be maximum €650 per person.
It is also possible to register for lunches and coffee breaks only (local participants), 
from Monday 8 June to Thursday 11 June with registration fee being maximum €250 per person (this also includes the fixed conference costs).
The final registration fee will be communicated with the green light, but will not exceed the amount mentioned above.

There might be also a shortage of single rooms. So it is not guaranteed that if you ask for a single room, you will be given such a single room. This will be confirmed also with the green light.

In case you wish to arrive on Sunday 7 June or earlier, or leave on Friday 12 June or later, so, for additional nights, 
please contact Mrs Montse Salas 
<a href="mailto:msalas@icmab.es">msalas@icmab.es</a>.
at the ICMAB, with a copy (IMPORTANT) to 
<a href="mailto:abidev2026@abinit.org">abidev2026@abinit.org</a>.
The cost of the additional nights (estimation to be provided soon) will have to be paid directly to the hotel. A credit card number might be needed to secure the booking.

If none of the above arrangements fits your needs, please contact the organisers at 
<a href="mailto:abidev2026@abinit.org">abidev2026@abinit.org</a>.
